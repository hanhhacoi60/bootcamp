# My Beginning Python Coding Exercises & Assignments

This is the repository where I am putting all the exercises and mini assignments from "The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp", which is a popular Udemy course by Colt Steele. Usually I will put my solutions that I came up with myself first. Then I will display the answer(s) that Colt recommends (such as answers that are cleaner/more efficient). 

I apologize if this Git Repository is messy! I'm still learning how to version control properly :)
